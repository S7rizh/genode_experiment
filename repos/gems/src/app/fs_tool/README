The fs_tool component performs a sequence of file operations on a locally
configured VFS. The file operations are given the configuration as follows:

! <config exit="yes">
!   <vfs>
!     ...
!   </vfs>
!   <new-file path="/path/to/file">Content to write to the file</new-file>
!   <remove-file path="/path/to/file" />
! </config>

The 'exit="yes"' attribute instructs the component to exit after completing
the sequence. Otherwise, the component keeps responding to configuration
changes by executing the operations found in the updated configurations.

The <new-file> operation creates the new file or overwrites the existing file
given through the 'path' attribute with the content that is given inside the
tag.

The <remove-file> tag removes the existing file given through the 'path'
attribute.
