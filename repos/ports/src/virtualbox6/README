VirtualBox configuration options
================================

The configuration requires an attribute named vbox_file with the name of the
vbox configuration to be used (.vbox).

<config vbox_file="file.vbox">

XHCI controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The virtual XHCI controller can be enabled with the following
configuration option:

<config xhci="yes">

CapsLock
~~~~~~~~

Per default CapsLock key events are send unmodified to guest
operating systems. As guest and host state may diverge, the event
filter optionally reports the capslock state as ROM, which can be
monitored by VirtualBox if configured like follows.

<config capslock="rom">

VirtualBox requests a "capslock" ROM, which is interpreted as XML. The
top-level node attribute 'enabled' is expected boolean and represents
the CapsLock state. If ROM and VM-internal CapsLock state differ, the
VMM sends aritifical CapsLock key events to the VM. In this mode,
incoming KEY_CAPSLOCK input events a dropped and not sent to the guest
to prevent the state divergence.
