USB GSM modem driver
####################

Driver for GSM modem cards connected via USB/M.2

Currently there is support for MBIM (Mobile Broadband Interface Model) devices
only. QMI devices might be supported in the future.

Tested devices:
Huawai ME906s      (P/V: 12d1:15c1)
Fibocom L830-EB-00 (P/V: 2cb7:0210)

Other devices can be added by enabling the MBIM configuration profile for the
USB device in ' Driver::Device::set_config' (main.cc) of this driver.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_modem_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!  <requires>
!    <service name="Uplink"/>
!  </requires>
!  <provides>
!    <service name="Terminal"/>
!  </provides>
!  <config mac="02:00:00:00:01:01"/>
!</start>

The driver offers two Genode sessions: The first one is a terminal session where
raw packet data, for example, MBIM packets can be send to the device via CDC WDM
(wireless communication device class). An example can be found in Genode World
(_src/app/mbimcli_). Once a data connection is established via the Terminal
session, the Uplink session can be used to transfer Ethernet frames.
