This directory contains the implementation of the Linux TAP based NIC driver.

The driver is a Linux hybrid component that uses the C library to
access the virtual TUN/TAP network devices. Therefore it requires
read-write access to /dev/net/tun and a TAP device configured to be
controlled by the user executing the component. The TAP device
defaults to tap0 and can be set up as follows.

! sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap user $USER

The used TAP device can be changed in the component configuration like
follows.

! <config tap="tap1"/>

The virtual NIC's MAC address defaults to 02-00-00-00-00-01 and can be
changed via

! <config mac="12:23:34:45:56:67"/>

The driver optionally reports the following information under the
label "devices" if requested in the config as depicted.

! <config> <report mac_address="true"/> </config>

! <devices> <nic label="tap0" mac_address="02:00:00:00:00:01"/> </devices>
