The RTC driver component provides access to the CMOS RTC on x86 via
the Rtc session. On base-linux 'gettimeofday' is used.

The component will use the content of the 'set_rtc' ROM if the
'allow_setting_rtc' attribute in the 'config' node is set to 'yes'
to allow setting the RTC. A valid ROM must contain a top node with
the following attributes:

* 'year' (e.g. 2019)
* 'month'  (1 - 12)
* 'day'    (1 - 31)
* 'hour'   (0 - 23)
* 'minute' (0 - 59)
* 'second' (0 - 59)

The same attributes can be set in the configuration node of the driver
to initially set the RTC to the givven value.

The component will always use 24H mode and relies on the BIOS/firmware
to do the right thing regarding the year.
