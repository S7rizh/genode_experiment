The NIC-router-DHCP test is meant to test and demonstrate the functionalities
of the NIC router that correspond to the management of networks through DHCP.
This comprises the abilities of the router to basically act as DHCP client and
DHCP server, to recognize and propagate additional information through DHCP,
and to react to changes in DHCP environments.


Unmanaged test scenario
#######################

The test is integrated by the run scripts
'os/run/nic_router_dhcp_unmanaged.run' and 'os/run/nic_router_managed.run'.
The "unmanaged" variant creates the following setup:


+--------------------------------------+   Received
| Test Client                          |   DHCP info
| (DHCP Client 2)                      |---------------->  Serial Output
+--------------------------------------+
                       |
                       | NIC session
                       |
                       v
+---------------+-------------------+--+
| NIC Router 2  | Domain Downlink 2 |  |
|               | (DHCP Server 2)   |  |
|               +-------------------+  |
|                      ^               |
|                      | Built-in      |
|                      | DNS config    |
|                      | forwarding    |
|                      |               |
|                      |               |
|               +-------------------+  |
|               | Domain Uplink     |  |
|               | (DHCP Client 1)   |  |
+---------------+-------------------+--+
                       |
                       | NIC session
                       |
                       v
+---------------+-------------------+--+   Reconfigure
| NIC Router 1  | Domain Downlink 1 |  |   DHCP server   +--------------+
|               | (DHCP Server 1)   |  |<----------------| Dynamic ROM  |
|               +-------------------+  |                 +--------------+
|                                      |
+--------------------------------------+


Throughout the test, the dynamic ROM changes the setup of DHCP Server 1
multiple times. This results also in changes of the additional information
propagated via DHCP. As a reaction to the changes, the link state of domain
Downlink 1 does a "down-up" sequence in order to advise all connected DHCP
clients to reset. DHCP Client 1 does so and receives the updated information
for its domain Uplink.

But the domain Uplink is also watched by Downlink 2 for a DNS configuration
through the router-internal forwarding mechanism (currently only DNS server
addresses, see attribute 'dns_config_from'). Therefore, the reset of DHCP
Client 1 also causes the link state of Downlink 2 to go "down" until DHCP
Client 1 finishes re-requesting DHCP. This causes DHCP Client 2 in the test
client (os/src/test/nic_router_dhcp/manager) to reset and re-request all DHCP
information from DHCP Server 2 and thereby apply the updated DNS configuration
(originating from DHCP Server 1) as soon as Downlink 2 is "up" again.

The test terminates successfully when the test client has printed a certain
sequence of successively received DHCP setups to the serial output. It fails,
at the other hand, when the expected output wasn't observed for a certain time.


Managed test scenario
#####################

The "managed" variant of test differs only in one detail from the "unmanaged"
variant: It doesn't use the router-internal mechanism for forwarding DNS
configurations from domain Uplink to domain Downlink 2. Instead, it achieves
the forwarding through an additional manager component
(os/src/test/nic_router_dhcp/manager):


+--------------------------------------+   Received

The manager initially writes out a router configuration using a Report session.
The configuration is received by NIC Router 2 through a ROM session. The
mediator between the managers Report and the routers ROM session is a Report
ROM server. The initial router configuration written by the manager is
basically the same as the static NIC-Router-2 configuration in the "unmanaged"
scenario with the small addition that it causes the router to report its state.

Now, each time that the DNS configuration of domain Uplink changes, NIC Router
2 generates a new state report reflecting the update. The manager receives the
state update through its ROM session with the Report ROM server. The manager
checks whether the DNS configuration of domain Uplink was affected by the
update. If so, it generates a new router configuration injecting the new DNS
configuration into DHCP Server 2.

Note that the test manager takes care not to create endless feedback-response
loops by re-configuring the router only when the interesting part of the router
state changes (the DNS configuration of domain Uplink). The test manager
reduces re-configuration even further by doing it only when the DNS
configuration at domain Uplink became valid. This means that it skips the short
periods where DHCP Client 1 is waiting for the re-request to finish and no DNS
configuration is available. It's fine for DHCP Server 2 to stay with the
outdated information during this time as no basic DHCP information is affected
and routing via Uplink remains blocked until DHCP finished anyway.

The rest of the process remains the same as in the "unmanaged" variant. The
"managed" approach has the benefit that the forwarding of DNS configurations
can be adapted to scenarios with special requirements. For instance, one might
want to filter information in order to restrict or protect the client behind
the router.
