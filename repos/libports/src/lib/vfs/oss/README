The VFS OSS plugin offers access to Genode's Audio_out session by providing a
file-system that can be mounted at arbitrary location within the VFS of a
component. It exposes a data file that can be used as 'dsp' file, e.g., _/dev/dsp_
as is common with OSS. The support I/O control operations or rather the
properties of the pseudo-device are provided in form of a structured 'info'
file located in the directory named after the data file, e.g., _/dev/.dsp/info_.

This file may by used to query the configured parameters and has the following
structure:

! <oss channels="2" sample_rate="44000" format="16"
!      ofrag_total="256" ofrag_size="2048" ofrag_avail="256"
|      optr_samples="0" optr_fifo_samples="0" play_underruns="0"/>

Each parameter can also be accessed via its own file. The following list
presents all files:

  * :channels (ro): number of available channels. Set to 2 (stereo).
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS'

  * :sample_rate (ro): sample rate of the underlying Audio_out session.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED'

  * :format (ro): sample format, e.g. s16le. Defaults to AFMT_S16_LE.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SAMPLESIZE'

  * :ofrag_total (rw): total number of output fragments. Set to number of packets
    in the underlying Audio_out session's packet-stream by default.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT', 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :ofrag_size (rw): size of an output fragment. Set to 2048 (number of channels
    times size of Audio_out period times size of s16le sample) by default.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT', 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :ofrag_avail (ro): number of available output fragments. Initially set to total
    fragment count.
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE'

  * :optr_samples (ro): total number of samples submitted to the Audio_out session
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_CURRENT_OPTR'

  * :optr_fifo_samples (ro): number of samples residing in the Audio_out stream
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_CURRENT_OPTR'

  * :play_underruns (rw): number of detected underrun errors, Writing anything
    into this file resets the value to zero 
    Corresponding OSS commands: 'SNDCTL_DSP_GETERROR'

In its current state it is merely enough to use simple applications requiring
nothing more than a minimal set of the OSSv4 API. It does not allow altering
of all parameters and will only work when 44100Hz/s16le is used.

The following config snippet illustrates its configuration:

! <vfs>
!   <dir name="dev">
!     <oss name="dsp"/>
!   </dir>
! </vfs>
